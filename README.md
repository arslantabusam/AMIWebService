# AMIWebService
This project involves the creation of a web service, capable of retrieving data from a SQLite database via JDBC and returning it formatted in specified JSON, XML and plain text formats.

Due to GitHub's maximum file size constraints, I have removed the original SQLite database file containing all the data from the motorways and have included an empty file to give reference on file location.
If you are interested in this Web Service and want to try it out yourself, you can request it by sending an email to this address: Tabusamarslan@gmail.com

Goals during this project: 

* Design and implement object-oriented applications and understand principles relating to interactive user interface development
* Use tools and techniques and utilise existing classes and libraries in a systematic way to develop a complex software application
* Design software using standard architectures to develop robust, scalable, and maintainable applications
