# AMIWebService
This project involves the creation of a web service, capable of retrieving data from a database via JDBC and returning it formatted in specified JSON, XML and plain text formats.

Due to GitHub's maximum file size constraints, I have removed the original SQLite database file containing all the data from the motorways and have included an empty file to give reference on file location.
If you are interested in this Web Service and want to try it out yourself, you can request it by sending an email to this address: Tabusamarslan@gmail.com
